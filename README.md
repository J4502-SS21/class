# J4502/7502, Spring 2021
Welcome to J4502: Multimedia Planning and Design

This is the repository for Multimedia Planning and Design. Here, Patrick will post sample code throughout the semester. You'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside best practices.

You'll learn how to use repositories like this one throughout the semester.

For now, go ahead and download the two programs we'll be using in this class:

* Atom (text editor) [For Mac](https://atom.io) | [For Other Platforms](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.2.4)

* GitHub Desktop (aka the cat app) [For Mac](https://desktop.github.com) | [For Windows](https://desktop.github.com)

We'll also be using [Slack](https://j4502spring2021.slack.com/) to communicate. You can use it in a browser, but previous instructors have highly recommended the [desktop app](https://slack.com/apps) and the mobile app: [For iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8) | [For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=en) | [For Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/slack-beta/9nblggh1jj9h).

You should also have a browser on your computer. More than one is even better! A few I recommend are:

* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

Looking forward to coding!  

â€” Patrick.
